# gain and noise floor

gain is basically volume for your antenna, it makes everything louder, but it does not magically create a signal where there isn’t one

the noise floor is the constant background static from the world and from your own hardware, think of it like the hum of a crowded room that never fully goes away

when you crank the gain, you boost the signal, but you also boost the noise floor at the same time, if you push it too hard everything turns into a distorted mess and the real signal gets buried inside the static

this is why more gain is not always better, once the noise floor rises too high, you lose detail instead of gaining it

the real goal is not maximum volume, it is contrast, you want the signal to clearly poke above the noise floor so you can actually read it

think of it like trying to hear a whisper, making the whole room louder does not help, it just makes the whisper harder to hear
