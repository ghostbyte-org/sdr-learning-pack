# rf safety and boundaries

look, having sharp tools means you need sharp discipline, this kit is about learning how the world talks, not messing with random people or causing noise

rule number one is simple, only experiment on hardware you actually own, if it is not yours, do not touch it

stay far away from emergency, aviation, and police frequencies, messing with those is not hacking, it is dangerous and stupid, people rely on those systems for safety, so leave them alone

do not transmit unless you know exactly what you are doing, if you are testing indoors use a dummy load so your signal does not leak out, keep your noise to yourself

the goal here is understanding how systems work, not showing off or annoying neighbors, real pros respect privacy, do not track people, and stay ethical

learn fast, break nothing, and stay inside the lines.
