# sdr-learning-pack
Offline-first SDR learning material for students studying RF fundamentals using GNU Radio and recorded signals.

This repository contains offline first learning material for students studying software Defined Radio (SDR) and RF fundamentals using GNU Radio.

The material is designed for learners who understand basic networking and signal concepts but do not have access to SDR hardware.

Learning is done using recorded
signals, simulations, and filebased GNU Radio flowgraphs.

This project is maintained by a small studentled study group conducting local, offline learning sessions for under resourced learners. We intentionally avoid
tracking participants or collecting personal data.

The repository will include:
- Core SDR and RF concepts explained concisely
- GNU Radio flowgraphs using file-based signal sources
- Offline lab exercises
- RF safety, ethics, and legal boundaries

This project does NOT support illegal transmission, interference with licensed services, or experimentation on hardware not owned by the learner.
