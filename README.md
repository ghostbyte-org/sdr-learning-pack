# SDR Learning Pack

this repository contains offline-first learning material for students studying
software defined radio (sdr) and rf fundamentals using gnu radio.

the material is designed for learners who understand basic networking and signal
concepts but do not have access to sdr hardware. learning is done using recorded
signals, simulations, and file-based gnu radio flowgraphs.

this project is maintained by a small student-led study group conducting local,
offline learning sessions for under-resourced learners. we intentionally avoid
tracking participants or collecting personal data.

## why this exists

most sdr learning resources assume you already own hardware. this pack is built to remove that barrier by teaching rf fundamentals using iq files, simulations, and offline-first labs, so students can learn before they can afford or access real radios.

## how to use this pack

this pack is meant to be followed in order.

start with the concepts to build intuition, then move to the lab to apply what
you learned. nothing here requires live transmission or radio hardware.

recommended flow:
1. read the concepts in order
2. understand the boundaries and safety rules
3. complete the fm receiver lab using an iq file

## scope and boundaries

this project does not encourage or support illegal transmission, interference
with licensed services, or experimentation on hardware not owned by the learner.

the goal is understanding how radio systems work, not showing off or causing harm.
